## Example

Create a text file (for example "C:\My Album\album.txt"). Put images you want to have in your document into text file. Each line of file should have one image name. Image file name can be relative to text file path.

Run following command to create document:

``` shell
depress "C:\My Album\album.txt" "C:\My Album\album.djvu"
```

Let's imagine you want to create a textbook with illustrations scanned at 600 dpi. You can use following command:

``` shell
depress -quality 70 -dpi 600 -layered -laydownall 2 -laydownfg 2 "C:\My Album\album.txt" "C:\My Album\album.djvu"
```
